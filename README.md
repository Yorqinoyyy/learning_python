# Python Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains the Python codes I write while learning programming step by step.  
It includes examples, exercises, and notes I practice every day to improve my skills.  

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- if-else statements: Basic conditions and decision making.
- loops (for & while): Iterations and repetitive tasks.
- (More will be added soon: functions, lists, dictionaries, etc.)

## 🗓️ Daily Learning Log:
- Day 1: Learned basic if-else conditions and practiced with 7 examples.  
- Day 2: Studied for and while loops and implemented examples like FizzBuzz.  
- Day 3: Learned about defining functions in Python. Practiced creating simple functions, using parameters, returning values, and real-life examples.
 -Day 4: Learned about lists, dictionaries, and file handling in Python.  
  Practiced list operations (append, slice, remove), worked with key-value pairs in dictionaries, and learned how to read/write files.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy and Pandas (coming soon)  

## ✨ Purpose:
I created this repo to track my learning progress and build a portfolio while studying Python for Data Science.  
Feel free to check my examples if you're also a beginner! 🌱
